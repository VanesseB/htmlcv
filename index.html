          <p>
            I am currently studying BSc Computing at the <a href ="https://www.unisa.ac.za/sites/corporate/default"> 
            University of South
            Africa(UNISA)</a> part-time. My majors are in Computer Science and Information
            Systems. I have also worked as a Data Science Intern at the <a href="https://explore-datascience.net/">
            Explore Data
            Science Academy.</a>
            <br>
            I love learning new things so I spent most of my time reading books,
            finding courses I can take to learn a new skill or improve on an area I'm
            struggling with. I also write blog posts on self-improvement and I
            occasionally code to learn a new language or dive deeper into a language I
            already know. Besides studying, I am also currently teaching myself new
            programming languages to pursue a career in front-end development.
